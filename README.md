# word-autocomplete-feature

In this project, I have implemented word autocomplete feature using TRIE data structure.

I have used shakespeare.txt and warpeace.txt as my corpus.

I suggest 5 highest used words as per their countings.

Currently, it's only simple terminal code but in future updates, a GUI may be added.

may data be with you!!
